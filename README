The router for this assignment is implemented in Python using the Tkinter
framework. It has been developed on Linux and requires Python 3.2.3 or
higher and Tk 8.5. Python 3 is generally included in most Linux
distributions and Tkinter is part of the Python Standard Library.

In order to run the program simply run the router.py file with the
python3 interpreter:

	python3 router.py

This opens the GUI where benchmark files can be opened with the "Open"
button and routed by pressing "Route".
